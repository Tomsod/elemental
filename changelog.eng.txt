== Elemental Mod ver. 1.0 ==

=== Main change: revamped, MM6-like elemental system ===

All attacks (spell or otherwise) now belong to one of the following elements:
fire, shock (electricity), cold, poison, physical (e.g. weapon attacks),
mind, magic, holy (undead-targeting attacks), or energy (ignores resistances).

It differs from MM6 in that mind is separate from magic (I think the reason
there were so many magic-immune monsters in MM6 (undead, titans, elementals...)
is that NWC wanted to make them immune to mental attacks, and those were
magic-elemental), and there's a formal element for anti-undead spells.

Spell elements mostly follow MM6, but there are some differences. Here's
the complete list:

All Fire spells, as well as Sunray, attack with fire.
Sparks, Lightning Bolt and Starburst attack with electricity.
Ice Bolt, Ice Blast and Souldrinker* attack with cold.
Poison Spray, Acid Burst and Toxic Cloud attack with poison.
Impolsion, Flying Fist**, Shrapmetal, and most direct-damage Earth spells
are physical attacks.
All Mind spells attack with mind.
Mass Distortion, Spirit Lash, Harm, Prismatic Light, Armageddon
and most debuffs attack with (non-elemental) magic.
Turn Undead***, Destroy Undead and Control Undead attack with holy.
Light Bolt attacks with energy, meaning it can't be resisted.
Dragon Breath attacks with both fire and poison, much like MM8 Darkfire Bolt.
For resisting this spell, the lesser of the two resistances applies.

* I initially intended to make Souldrinker magic-elemental, but there's
already Prismatic Light, and plenty of other magic spells, while cold
was underrepresented.  Hopefully the "sepulchral cold" excuse makes sense.
** This is a change from MM6.  I'm not completely sure the fist is not
a metaphor, but if it's not, the physical damage makes more sense.
*** Turn Undead cannot actually be resisted, but it won't affect
creatures immune to holy (i.e. non-undead).

Poisoned weapons once again attack with poison instead of body.
Blasters attack with energy.

Monster attacks and resistances have been reworked.  Generally,
non-spellcasting monsters are vulnerable to magic; natural, non-poisonous
monsters are vulnerable to poison, fire-based monsters are vulnerable to cold,
and cold-based monsters are vulnerable to fire.  In other cases, poison
resistance was copied from body, magic is approximately light and dark
averaged, and for undead, spirit was converted to holy.  (Non-undead monsters
are immune to holy by definition.)  Monsters that attacked with light
and "earth" now attack with energy; dark attacks are converted to magic.
Water attacks are now either cold or poison.

The six elemental resistance spells have been renamed appropriately,
so, Earth now has Magic Resistance spell, Body has Poison Resistance, etc.
I've managed to draw new buff icons (on the buff panel in the middle-right),
but the spellbook images and spell-casting animation are a bit beyond my skill.
Thankfully, they are mostly vague enough to pass as-is.
I've also renamed Protection from Magic to Immutability to avoid confusion.

There's a couple of other minor changes, such as the new poison resistance
protecting from the poisoned condition, and Phynaxian Crown boosting both
cold and poison resistance.

One notable tweak: base stats (Might, Intellect, etc.) are now more effective
at preventing harmful conditions.  To elaborate: some conditions can be
prevented by having high base stats, and others, by high elemental resistances.
But in the original game even with 500+ in all stats the PC only had
a 2-in-3 chance to resist stat-based conditions, while for resistance-based
ones one only needed 50-60 or so to achieve the same level of protection.
Now, base stats are about 4 times more effective for this purpose.


=== Undead-related changes ===

I've gone on a surprisingly lengthy detour with various undead-related changes
while developing this mod.  In addition to the new holy element, these
mostly concern undead PCs.

The original lich immunities were weird!  The character got 200 body and
mind resistance on lichification, and then any resistance that was 200 or above
was treated as an immunity.  That meant a lich could become immune to
other elements by stacking enough buffs; conversely, if body or mind resistance
was lowered (e.g. by equipping Hareck's Leather), the existing immunity
was lost.

In this mod, liches are immune to poison and mind, always, and
their resistances aren't even checked for this purpose.  In addition,
zombified players are given the same immunities.  The price for this is the
vulnerability to holy attacks.  Some monsters (priests, wizards and angels)
can now cast Turn Undead or Destroy Undead if they detect an undead in your
party.  Turn Undead scares all undead PC, unconditionally; Destroy Undead
deals holy damage to one PC.  Liches have some holy resistance (20 plus any
luck bonus); other zombified PCs are completely vulnerable.

Reanimation spell is also changed: the zombified creature now has the same
changes as the zombified PC (poison and mind immunity, but vulnerable to holy).
Monsters that can cast Destroy Undead may target these monsters as well.

Also, dark temples now don't turn stoned players and liches to zombies.


=== Bug fixes ===

While browsing the disassembly, I also found and fixed a few bugs in the
original game.  I've forwarded those to GrayFace, so hopefully the fixes
will be included in the next version of MM7Patch.  But for now, they'll be
in this mod, because why not.

Fix: "of Assasins" and "of Barbarians" weren't dealing elemental damage.
Fix: Kelebrim wasn't substracting 30 from earth (now poison) resistance.
Fix: Armageddon could not be resisted (now magic resistance applies).
Fix: control undead on the GM level did not work.
Fix: charm on the M level did not work; also, on the GM level it acted
like on E, and on E it acted like on M.
Fix: when monster cast spells on another monster, wrong resistance was checked.
Fix: some pre-placed monsters had spells they couldn't cast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Elemental Mod ver. 2.0 ==

While I originally intended to create a separate balance-concerned mod for
MM7, I ended up extending this mod with all of my ideas instead.  As such,
"Elemental Mod" is slowly becoming an artifact title.  Well, at least it's
catchy!  The final vision for this mod is to "polish" the game by improving
game mechanics, adding convenient new features, and hopefully improving, or at
least not breaking too much, balance.

This release mostly concerns itself with the magic system (broadly speaking).
There's also a bunch of rule changes and a surprising number of bug fixes.
Hopefully, the latter will be eventually assimilated by the MM7Patch.


=== Alchemy changes ===

The first main topic of change is potions.  In general, alchemy should be more
useful and versatile now, and having a Druid is rewarding.

Several new black potions have been added.  Six of them provide a temporary
immunity to one of six elements (fire, shock, cold, poison, mind, or magic).
Their duration is quite short, but complete elemental immunity is hard to
obtain otherwise, which gives an edge to Druids who alone can brew these
potions freely.  There's also a black potion that duplicates the Pain
Reflection spell.

Alchemy has been given an offensive option it lacked before by repurposing
weapon-enchancing elemental potions into short-range AOE thrown weapons.
(They still retain their old utility, as well.)  Thrown potions are affected
by gravity, so their range is limited, especially for characters with low
Might.  On impact, they explode, damaging monsters in a small radius.  Damage
is (power)d3 for Flaming and Freezing potions and (power)d2 for Shocking and
Noxious potions.

Another new quasi-potion is holy water.  It's outside the alchemy system, but
behaves like a potion otherwise.  Holy water can be bought at most temples and
acts similarly to the potions from the above paragraph, able to either
temporarily make one weapon Undead Slaying, or be thrown to damage a group of
undead monsters.  Unlike elemental potions, the thrown holy water is safe to
use at a point-blank range -- unless, of course, you have undead in the party.
Holy water is especially notable as one of the few ways to reliably damage
Ghosts and Wraiths, who are now immune to unenchanted weapons.

Swift Potions have also been given a new functionality: drinking them causes
the character to instantly recover (i.e. get an extra turn).  It's probably a
suboptimal use of a potion in most cases, but some spells (e.g. Ressurection)
have very long recovery which could make it worthwhile in a combat situation.

There's a number of tweaks as well.  Notably, black potions of Pure Attribute
(Might, Accuracy, etc.) now give a bonus equal to their power instead of a
fixed +50.  Since they're usually generated with 20-30 power, this adds a
strategic dilemma: do you drink one as soon as you find it, obtaining a
smaller bonus early, or wait until you find a Philosopher's Stone and an
Alchemy-boosting item, which together can improve the potion's power to 100+,
thus giving your character a bigger, but delayed, bonus?  You're still limited
to one of each potion per character, so you cannot choose both!

Potions of Bless, Heroism and Stoneskin have been made a lot less useless by
adding half of the potion's power to the resulting buff's power.  (Previously,
these potions always gave the minimal possible bonus of +5, which could be a
bug.)

Slaying Potions now have a permanent effect if posiible.  Honestly, I was
somewhat surprised to learn they didn't have it already.

Most potions (specifically, those for which power matters) now have variable
price dependent on power.  For typical randomly generated power values, the
resulting price should stay around the same.

The potion recipes sold at alchemy shops have been improved as well.
They now list the exact needed mixtures instead of cryptic guidelines, and
reading them automatically adds the recipe to your journal.  With the
proliferation of spoilers, trying to get the players to discover the recipes
for themselves is pointless anyway!

Last, but not least, I've added an ability to brew any potion in a single
click, provided you know the relevant recipes, have the reagents and enough
bottles, and posess the necessary Alchemy skill!  It's as simple as
Ctrl-clicking on an existing potion, or its recipe.  The game will then
attempt to brew another potion of the same type, first from other potions, or
otherwise from base reagents.  It works exactly like brewing it manually, and
you will be given a descriptive message if the process fails.  This
functionality is mostly intended to help streamline batch-brewing potions.
I'm quite proud of this one.


=== Item enchantments ===

The next major part of this release concerns item enchantments AKA bonuses,
such as "Vampiric" or "of the Gods".  Actually, I mostly concerned myself with
weapon bonuses specifically.  One of the mod's goals is to strengthen weapon
combat, as it's commonly considered inferior to magic, and improving weapon
enchantments helps towards that.

First off, I added a total of nine non-numeric enchantments.  In the below
list, "tlvl" stands for treasure level, which ranges from 1 to 6.

Spectral: any weapon, tlvl 3-5.  Improves the weapon's resistance penetration
by changing the element of the attack from physical to magical when it's
beneficial.  This allows damaging monsters that are immune to normal weapons,
such as Oozes; the mod also gives this immunity to Ghosts and Wraiths, and
this enchantment is one of the best ways to deal with them.  It's still
helpful against other monsters, as many enemies are vulnerable to Magic.
When fighting with two weapons, only one of which is Spectral, the enchantment
only affects 50% of the combined damage.

Cursed: any weapon, tlvl 4-5.  When hitting a monster with this weapon, it
will apply the Cursed debuff with a 20% chance.  Monsters that fail a Magic
resistance roll will, for the next 20 minutes, have halved chance to-hit, 50%
chance of a spell failure, and about 25% lowered elemental resistances.
This is mostly identical to MM6 Mass Curse spell (except for the last part),
but in this mod, weapons are the only source of the debuff.  Wielding two
Cursed weapons provides no additional benefit.

Of The Wraith: any weapon, tlvl 5-6, uncommon.  Combines effects of Spectral
and Cursed.

Soul Stealing: melee weapon, tlvl 5-6, rare.  A counterpart to Vampiric
weapons, it will restore some spell points when the character kills an enemy
in melee.  Wielding two such weapons doubles the effect.

Of Backstabbing: melee weapon, tlvl 3-5.  Another "double damage" enchantment,
this one works on any monster, but only if they're turned away from you.
Usually enemies will look at you in combat; reliable ways to get them to turn
around are Mass Fear (or Turn Undead), or Berserk to provoke infighting.

Lightweight: body armor and shields, tlvl 3-5.  Reduces the armor's recovery
penalty by 10, assuming it's not already nullified by skill.  This means that
Lightweight leather and shields never slow the character down at all, and
chain and plate with this enchantment will have a penalty of 0 and 5
respectively when combined with Expertise in relevant skill.

Of Leaping: boots, tlvl 3-4.  Each pair of boots of Leaping increases jump
power by 20%, and multiple pairs stack linearly.  They do not affect the Jump
spell.

Of Permanence: shields, helmets and jewelry, tlvl 4-5, uncommon.  Make the
wearer immune to the Dispel Magic monster spell.  This spell is nerfed in
several ways in this mod, and this is one of them.

Sturdy: anything but belts or jewelry, tlvl 3-4, rare.  The enchanted item can
never break.  Essentially duplicates the effect of Harden Item potion.

Next, I've completely rehauled the temporary enchantment system as provided by
Fire Aura and such.  Now pretty much any weapon can have a temporary
enchantment, including already enchanted weapons and artifacts.  This means
that a weapon can have two bonuses at the same time (permanent and temporary),
and it also means that Fire Aura no longer becomes useless when you outfit the
party with good enchanted weapons.  The only limitation is that the temporary
enchantment musn't be similar in nature to already present bonuses.  For
example, Ghoulsbane cannot be enchanted with Fire Aura or holy water, and
weapons of Darkness are unaffected by Vampiric Weapon spell and Swift Potions.
Also, due to their unique nature, bows of Carnage can only be made Swift.

Among other changes, Undead Slaying weapons now act similarly to the new
Spectral weapons, dealing Holy damage when attacking Undead.  As noted above,
this makes holy water very helpful against Ghosts and Wraiths in partucular.
Most Undead are very vulnerable to Holy, making this enchantment superior to
Spectral within its scope of effect, especially considering the double damage.

Also, Assassins' weapons now have backstab instead of the modest Disarm bonus.


=== Spell tweaks ===

Probably the core content of this release is the multitude of player spell
tweaks.  Some spells are improved, some are nerfed, and one spell is entirely
replaced.  One goal I strived towards was to make GM changes of spell effects
more significant, as many spells had underwhelming changes at grandmastery in
vanilla.  This was partly because the magic system was blindly copied from
MM6, where any spell could be cast at any level of mastery, and even high-cost
spells were substantially better at Master (which was harder to attain than
MM7 Master).  But in MM7 spell availability is limited by skill, and as the
result the weaker effects of higher-level spells were simply discarded, often
leaving them overpowered from the get-go, and with no room for improvement at
GM.  As such, many spells are now rebalanced by shifting them one level of
mastery upwards, with Expert having the effect of MM6 Normal skill, Master
casting as Expert, and GM working as the previous Master.  Some other spells
were instead just made stronger at GM.  I also improved most debuffs.

Condition cure spells are the prime example of the "shifting" approach, as the
vanilla GM bonus of unlimited delay was just too useless -- as rightly noted,
at Master the allowed delay is already 7 days, and who would wait over a week
before casting a cure?  So, all Expert- and Master-level cure spells are now
shifted to 3 min/level at E, 1 hour/level at M, and 1 day/level at GM.  Cure
Weakness and Remove Fear are improved instead, acting on the entire party on
GM.  Awaken already had, so I just removed the unlimited delay to keep it
uniform, but left the shortened recovery in place.

Ressurection merits special mention, as I felt having a slightly improved
Raise Dead as Spirit's ultimate spell was a bit underwhelming.  Now it's a
"combat revival" sort of spell, as not only it ressurects, it also doesn't
inflict weakness and restores some HP, leaving the character ready for combat.
It can still cure eradication like in vanilla, and it remains the only cure
spell without a time limit.  The only practical downside is the 10-minute
recovery this spell imposes; I haven't changed that.  (The vanilla description
claims that higher skill lowers recovery, but this was never actually
implemented, and I removed that note.)

As mentioned above, I reworked the debuff spells.  While generally magic is
overpowered, this is not the case for debuffs, which are frustratingly
unreliable, especially in the late game.  Thus, I made spell skill improve
their success chance.  The improvement isn't dramatic -- with high skill
you'll get maybe 150% of the base chance against tougher targets -- but it's
still noticeable.  A price to pay for this is that the debuff duration is now
mostly fixed -- it increases with mastery, but the numeric skill value doesn't
affect it anymore.  Generally it's still enough to last through the combat,
though.  Turn Undead was also affected by the latter change for uniformity,
but since it cannot be resisted at all, higher skill reduces recovery instead.

I also added one completely new spell: Spectral Weapon.  It replaces Fate,
and, true to its name, can enchant one weapon to become Spectral.  It's a Self
counterpart to Fire Aura and Vampiric Weapon, and works much the same.  The
spell can be useful both in early game, when you need to fight Ghosts and
Oozes, and later, when a lot of monsters are less resistant to Magic than to
physical attacks.  Fate still can be found on scrolls, but you cannot learn it.
The icon for the new spell may be replaced with a better one in the future.

Next, I backported some spell changes from MM8.  Ice Blast now deals 12 +
(level)d6 damage (up from d3), Spirit Lash now damages all nearby monsters,
and Regeneration is massively nerfed from 5/10/15 HP per 5 minutes to 2/3/4.

Returning to shifted spells, Flight now only lasts 10 minutes/level at M, and
still drains magic at GM.  The three Light buff spells have all been nerfed as
well: Day of the Gods and Day of Protection now have lower mastery multipliers
(up to x4 at GM), and Hour of Power has more consistent duration -- the
vanilla MM7 used a very confusing formula that was probably wrong at several
places; now the duration exactly matches the duration of its constituent
spells cast at the equivalent skill level.  Strictly speaking, the two latter
buffs are now no better than casting their spells separately, assuming equal
skill; however, improving their effect requires only putting points in the
school of Light, as opposed to the seven schools that the separate spells are
spread amongst, so casting them can still be advantageous.

Other GM-level changes: GM Feather Fall grants the same bonus as boots of
Leaping, GM Torch Light gives even brighter light than M, and GM Wizard Eye
lasts permanently and can never be dispelled, not even by rest or travel.
If you do want to dispel it for some reason, just cast it again.  By the way,
Immolation now has this feature as well, as leaving it on can be dertimental
around friendly monsters.

Enchant Item is both buffed and nerfed.  On one hand, Master EI now normally
enchants at tlvl3 (down from 4), and GM, at tlvl4 (down from 5).  To enchant
at the vanilla power, you need to cast the spell at noon (from 11:00 to 12:59).
(The noon thing was planned but never implemented in MM6.)  On the other hand,
special (non-numeric) enchantments now scale with spell's tlvl instead of being
stuck at tlvl3, which was likely a bug.  Now you can even get "of the Dragon",
"of Darkness" and other top-tier enchantments, as long as you cast at GM and
at noon.  I also eliminated the exploit that allowed to enchant items of Arms
(or Dodging, or the Fist) higher than normally possible.

Preservation now halves the chance of monsters causing instant death or
eradication.  According to the manual, it was supposed to completely protect
from these conditions, but it was evidently deemed too powerful.  True, but I
think partial resistance is okay.  Makes the spell more useful, too.

Mass Distortion now cannot be entirely resisted, unless the monster is immune
to Magic.  (In vanilla it had a debuff-like resist-to-nullify check AND an
ordinary damage resistance check, and I consider this a bug.)

Sunray has been buffed by allowing it to be cast in some aboveground indoors
locations.  Generaly, if it's not a cave, dungeon, or anywhere in the Pit, you
should be able to cast Sunray while in it (during the daytime, of course).  As
it was in vanilla, the spell just couldn't compete with Meteor Shower and
similar outdoor nukes, so now it hopefully will be more useful.

Finally, Berserk spell gained a new functionality: it can be cast on a PC to
trigger the Insane condition (unless the PC is immune), with all its benefits
and downsides.


=== Item changes ===

The next batch of changes concerns artifacts and various other items.
Firstly, I added new properties to some artifacts both to make the artifacts
more competitive, and to make said properties more common.  Here's the list:

Splitter and Forge Gauntlets grant immunity to Fire.
Twilight grants immunity to Poison (as in the element).
Phynaxian Crown grants immunity to Cold (and some Poison resistance).
Mind's Eye grants immunity to Mind.
Elven Chainmail is now lightweight and adds +5 to Bow skill.
Old Nick has been significantly buffed number-wise.  It also now backstabs
instead of slaying elves.
Corsair also backstabs now.
Kelebrim grants immunity to Dispel Magic.
Hermes' Sandals increase jump height.

Elfbane has been completely replaced with Sacrificial Dagger, a new
Goblin-only artifact that increases maximum SP and has Soul Stealing property.

Morcarack (the Emerald Island dragon) now drops his scales instead of a random
tlvl 6 item.  This means he can no longer be multilooted until the party has a
full set of endgame gear; instead, the scales can later be made into one of
two unique items, plate armor or a shield.  Both grant Fire immunity (and
Morcarack is now also immune to fire, as he should be), and the plate is also
lightweight.  (Please note that the graphics for the new items are VERY
temporary; I'll replace them eventually as soon as I can involve some artist.)

Genie Lamps now give a quintuple bonus (from +5 to +20), and they can only
increase primary stats and resistances, much like in MM6 (except I put
Intellect and Personality on the same month to fit).

Basic-level spellbooks can now be found randomly, FWIW.

Blasters and wands are now equipped in the missile weapon slot (like bows).
Accordingly, they by default will not fire in melee range; if you do want to,
use the quick spell button (or shift-click on a monster) with no quick spell
set.  Also, I replaced wand spells Sparks and Spirit Lash with Slow and
Psychic Shock, as the former two aren't really ranged spells.

On that topic, somewhere in the process of reworking wands I introduced a bug
that often prevents them from making a sound when fired.  I wasn't able to fix
it, unfortunately.  It does not affect gameplay, though.

More wand changes: they no longer disappear when they're out of charges.  You
can see the maximum possible amount of charges the wand can have in its
description.  Wands often spawn not fully charged.  Equipped empty wands are
colored red, as if they were broken.  Wand price also depends on both its
current and maximun charges.  Finally, magic shops can now recharge wands!
Fancier shops can restore more charges, up to 80% of maximum.

The next few tweaks are intended to make melee slightly stronger.  Firstly,
the limit on attack speed has been raised -- it's now 10 attacks per round for
blasters and 5 for any other weapon.  This limit is enforced both in
turn-based and realtime mode.  Next, when using two weapons, the skill of the
weapon in the right hand affects the damage now.  (It used to be the left
hand, which was unfortunate as neither sword nor dagger skill give damage
bonuses to most classes.)  Lastly, most two-handed swords and axes gained a
bonus to damage, which will hopefully make them more competitive.

I also reworked the damage dice of many artifacts to bring them in line with
their base item types.  Charele was a special case, as its improbable 3d9+18
damage was the entire point of the artifact.  Now it has halberd dice and a
more realistic to-hit bonus, but it gets the two-handed damage bonus as an
unique artifact property.  Oh, and Mash is a club instead of a mace now.


=== Other changes ===

Probably the largest diversion in this release was when I decided to rework
the reputation system.  Now, instead of being stored per-map, your reputation
is shared between all locations in the same region.  The main benefit of the
new system is that the reputation given in castles and other indoor locations
is now meaningful.  The reputation penalties given in the dungeons (for theft,
murder etc.) now matter as well.  Additionally, having all of a dozen
different reputation counters made it easier to implement a gamescript command
to change reputation in another region; many quests have been changed to make
use of this.  The only places where reputation doesn't matters are Eeofol and
Shoals, as those regions are unpopulated; it always stays at zero there.

Other reputation changes: almost all quests change it now.  Theft doesn't,
unless you get caught.  Armageddon has a heavy reputation penalty.  Town hall
bounties improve reputation slightly.  Finally, "disreputable" NPCs such as
gypsies and pirates will now only change reputation in their home region, but
this change is permanent.  Rationale: with reputation affecting prices, the
Duper NPC, unlike in MM6, becomes almost useless.  Now, at least, the Duper's
Merchant bonus can be used at full effect if you travel to another region
after hiring them.

Temple donation rewards have been increased in power proportionally to the
donation cost.  They still depend on the day of the week, as well.

Barrels and cauldrons found in some maps give level-dependent bonuses now, up
to +15 at level 99.  Drink now or save for later, your choice!  On that note,
I also changed the barrels in the Walls of Mist so that they refill only once
per year instead of on each visit.  This was exploitable even in vanilla, but
with the above improvement it's just too much.

In vanilla, HP and SP could rarely rise above normal maximum.  It would stay
that way (unless lost or spend) until the first healing effect (including
regeneration), which would reset it to the limit.  That has been redone.  Now
there are more ways to legitimately "overheal" (Shared Life, Souldrinker,
Vampiric and Soul Stealing weapons, and occasionally potions), and healing
won't remove the extra points, but they will quickly dissipate on their own,
reducing by 25% every five minutes.

Monster Dispel Magic has been made less annoying.  In addition to items of
Permanence, it's now possible for party-wide enchantments to resist being
dispelled (a random PC's resistance is checked for each buff).  The base odds
of resisting have been increased fourfold as well, as it's one of the cases
where the game checks primary stats, and such checks were unreasonably
difficult in vanilla.

Cursed PCs have greatly reduced Luck for symmetry with Cursed monsters.

Wishing wells in Bracada and Eeofol are now limited-use (5/day for the former
and 12/month for the latter).  I also slightly changed the possible effects.

There are now exactly three challenges of each type instead of seven +5 ones
and scarcely any others.  Hopefully this will reduce the number of duplicates.

Right-clicking on character stats now displays the base stat value (without
items) and stat rating (which is used for most stat-related bonuses).

Dwarven guards have been put on a diet & exercise regimen.  Now they're much
less likely to get stuck in doorways and block passages with their girth.

Some spell descriptions have been rewritten; notably, spell schools now list
learnable spells.

Rest encounter probabilities are now more varied (used to be 10% almost
everywhere), and you won't be attacked by normally peaceful monsters.  Also,
resting is now safe if all monsters on the map are peaceful -- used to be that
your golem triggered goblin attacks in your castle, which was clearly a bug.

I tweaked shops a little: Tatalian island stores are now open at night, and
Castle Harmondale shops stay open till 23:00.  Also, castle potion shop is
replaced by a magic shop (for convenient selling), and former Nighon magic shop
now sells black potions (more reason to get there early).

Most AOE and shrapnel-like spells now should display a single combined message
for all damaged monsters -- at least in turn-based mode.  It can break if
another spell is cast before the previous one hits.  Similarly, stun,
paralysis, and halved armor messages are combined with the damage messages.
The only weapon that will still produce two messages is Splitter -- the
fireball that it spawns usually overwrites the regular damage message.  I
might fix that later.

Convenience feature: when one of the equipped items is broken, the character's
AC number becomes colored red.  Empty wands do not trigger this, though.

Steadwick ore smiths can now make two-handed weapons, bows, and shields.

Leaving the Grand Temple of the Moon now only deletes the Telekinesis scrolls
that were obtained from the unlimited-use secret panel.

Bookshelves are reworked slightly -- almost any spellbook can be looted, and I
removed the possibility of finding nothing -- if there's anything left, you
will always find it.  On that topic, high Perception affects bookshelves loot.

Many sarcophages in the Barrows have decent items inside, but graverobbing has
consequences!  Again, high Perception helps.

Finally, banks now add a 1% interest each week, like in older games.


=== Bug fixes ===

The more I mess around with MM7's code, the more bugs I discover.  So why not
to fix them!  Eventually most of these should end up in the MM7Patch.
