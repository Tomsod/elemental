First of all, my gratitude goes to GrayFace.  Without his pioneering work,
this mod would not happen.  While my mod does not use MMExtension,
I do utilize it while testing, and the documented structs are ever so useful.

Thank you to the fellows at mm6world.ru for providing a thorough guide
and being an occasional source of inspiration.

Thank you to Eksekk and my friends Kostya and Vladimir for playtesting
and fruitful discussions.

Also thank you to Eksekk for modifying the castle Harmondale map.

Special thanks to Arakazam who drew the RDSM and some other stuff for the mod.
You can probably commission him at asan.artstation.com.

Extra special thanks to Kaltenberg who modelled an entire new dungeon
for the mod and very patiently listened to my myriad quibbles.

I also stole a few ideas from the Merge and BTB's mod thread.
