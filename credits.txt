Thank you to the fellows at mm6world.ru for providing a thorough guide
and being an occasional source of inspiration.

Thank you to Eksekk and my friend Kostya for playtesting
and fruitful discussions.

Special thanks to Arakazam who drew the RDSM and some other stuff for the mod.
You can probably commission him at asan.artstation.com.

I also stole a few ideas from the Merge.
